                      <h1>Can you tell us a little about yourself?</h1>
                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        My weight has always been a little up and down (understatement of the century!). It's been as low as 8.5 stone, and as high as 13.5 stone. About 3 years ago I got seriously down in the dumps - I absolutely hated my 9 to 5 job that I was working, my wonderful grandad had just passed away, and everything just got on top of me. Food was just my complete comfort - it satisfied my misery, and my boredom. It seems drastic, piling on 3.5 stone in such a short space of time, but my clothes seemed to stretch with my body, so I could never really see how big I was getting. However, self-esteem started plummeting, I was suffering recurrent chest infections, and I was just utterly miserable - eating myself to a heart attack.
                        It really just sort of happened for me though...I just woke up one day and decided I didn't want to be like this anymore.
                      </p>

                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        I needed to get out of the house, and out of the fridge! So, I started going to Pilates 3 days a week to start with - I thought it would be helpful to my chest, and it was exercise that I could cope with. There's no way at the point I could run, or spin - I ran out of breath just walking up the stairs!
                        I took day 1 photographs (which I hated!) and Pinterest became my new best friend. I started off with a '28 day detox' - I saw on Pinterest that it takes 28 days to break a habit so I stuck to this. I cut out alcohol (I do love my wine!), carbs, and refined sugar. I had to learn to like salads and veg, almost forcing myself to eat new things and just reminding myself that it was fuel for my body. I'm not going to lie - it was tough. Day 1 and 2 are easy, you're full of motivation, but then it get's really hard. I stuck with it though and lost about 1.5 stone in the first 28 days.
                      </p>

                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        Clean food, no alcohol, and Pilates & Yoga. I didn't do anything high impact, it was all very mat based.
                        After the 28 days I started to introduce carbs and alcohol back into my diet, but I tried to stick to an 80/20 rule - 80% of my week being good, 80% of my day being good, 80% of my meal being good. I never deprived myself of anything, and didn't believe in diet plans so this worked amazing for me. And then the results just paid off! It really is true what they say, you can't exercise your way out of a bad diet.
                      </p>

                      <h1>What does your workout routine look like?</h1>
                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        When I first started my journey I did a lot of walking in addition to Pilates classes. It's always been very low-impact. I hate anything that involves jumping or running! Now, I do a lot of my own Pilates routines (not your traditional or classical mat Pilates, it's more intense and more challenging): lots of pliés, lots of ab work, and lots for the bum! And i choreograph it all to music so I don't get bored! I also love spin class, but I only do it once a week, possibly twice if I've got time.
                      </p>

                      <h1>Which products have had the most significant impact on your fitness journey?</h1>
                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        Hmmm, this is hard! I didn't really swear by any products if I'm honest. The things that have really impacted my journey are free! Pinterest has had a massive impact on my journey - food, inspiration, routine ideas. And taking photos - always take photos, as many as you can - you can really see your journey and have a great visual. Music is the last thing - I NEED good music; it makes me work so much harder.
                      </p>

                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        I’m really keen on my NutriBullet for Pinterest - I like to make a lot of homemade hummus and soups. Which saves me mashing it all up by hand!
                      </p>

                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        I’ve never used a measuring tape - reason being, if you’re losing fat but gaining muscle, you could potentially increase in inches in some places and lose from others. I just went by how I looked in photos - comparing new ones to old ones.
                      </p>

                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        I mostly just use my phone (iPhone 6) but occasionally I’ll dig out my DSLR Nikon! Most of the photos on my Instagram are from my phone though.
                      </p>

                      <p class="mrg--bottom">
                        I like to use my Marley headphones, although, I much prefer just blasting the music out on the Bose! Music has to be loud for me to workout hard.
                      </p>

                        Perseverance is key - it wasn't all plain sailing. It was taking 1 step forward and 2 back. Don't punish yourself if you slip up, and certainly don't throw the towel in. Just get yourself back on track, and find things that keep your head in the game!
