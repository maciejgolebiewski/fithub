                      <p>
												Our goal is to share first-hand accounts of how people achieved the fitness results that they did and which fitness products they used along the way.
											</p>
											<p>
												We like to hear from people when theyâ€™re in the trenches; honest and candid conversations with people who have discovered the rewards and challenges of what it means to live a fitness lifestyle.
											</p>
											<p>
												Our vision is to be a thriving community where people come to get inspired by reading about others who are on a similar path sharing their experiences; their challenges, their victories, and everything else inbetween.
